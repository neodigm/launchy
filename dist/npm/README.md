## Usage

_Launchy!_ is very easy to install and use:

### HTML
Wherever you want to have a _Launchy!_ control + window appear in your HTML content, simply **wrap** your content with a `<div>` and add the `data-launchy` attribute.

Example:

```html
<div data-launchy data-launchy-text="Launch window!" data-launchy-title="My modal window">
    <p>This content will appear in the modal window.</p>
</div>
```

- **Required**: `data-launchy` -- Attribute is required but the value can be anything
- **Required**: `data-launchy-text` -- This is the text that will be output to the launcher control
- Optional: `data-launchy-title` -- The text which appears in the heading of the modal window, recommended for greater a11y context üëç


#### Custom Close Controls

You can add your own custom close controls to any _Launchy!_ modal window!

1. Add the HTML element you wish to use for the control within your content
2. Apply the `data-launchy-close` attribute

Example:

```html
<div data-launchy data-launchy-text="Launch window!" data-launchy-title="My modal window">
    <p>This content will appear in the modal window.</p>
    <a href="#" data-launchy-close="üî•">Ok!</a>
</div>
```

Clicking on the _"Ok!"_ link will hide the modal window and send focus back to the launcher control!

#### Custom Refocus Controls

You can add your own custom "refocus" controls to any _Launchy!_ modal window!

1. Add the HTML element you wish to use for the control within your content
2. Apply the `data-launchy-refocus` attribute
3. Set the value of the `data-launchy-refocus` attribute to the `id` of the element you wish to send focus to

Example:

```html
<div data-launchy data-launchy-text="Launch window!" data-launchy-title="My modal window">
    <p>This content will appear in the modal window.</p>
    <a href="#" data-launchy-refocus="post-title">Send me to the article headline!</a>
</div>

<!-- Somewhere else in your page‚Ä¶ -->
<h1 id="post-title" tabindex="-1">My perfect sundae‚Ä¶</h1>
```

Clicking on the _"Send me to the article headline!"_ link will hide the modal window and shift keyboard focus to the `<h1 id="post-title"/>` element!

### CSS

_Launchy!_ has many CSS classes available on its generated elements for custom styles. Check out the [style.scss](https://github.com/svinkle/launchy/blob/master/brochure/css/sass/styles.scss) file for class names and an example on how you might want to style your modal windows!

### JavaScript
For any site, grab the `/dist/launchy.js` file and include it at the bottom of your HTML page/template:

```html
<script src="js/launchy.js"></script>
```

_Launchy!_ will run automatically and generate all the modal windows for you!

### `npm` Package
_Launchy!_ is also available as an npm package!

#### Install
```sh
npm i launchy-modal-window
```

#### Usage
Include the `launchy.js` directly in your app or site template.

```html
<script src="node_modules/launchy-modal-window/launchy.js"></script>
```
